The experiments in this assignment will take a long time to run without a GPU, but you can run the notebook remotely on Google Colab and have access to GPUs for free -- in this case you don't have to worry about installing PyTorch as it is available by default in Google Colab's environment.\n",

        "Unlike previous assignments, in this one you will have to do some writing instead of just coding. Try to keep your answers short and precise, and you are encouraged to write equations if needed (you can do that using markdown cells). You can also use code as part of your answers (like plotting and printing, etc). Blue text indicates questions or things that you should discuss/comment, and there will red \"ANSWER (BEGIN)\" and \"ANSWER (END)\" markdown cells to indicate that you should add cells with your writeup between these two. **Make sure not to redefine variables or functions in your writeup, which can change the behavior of the next cells.**\n",

We are able to train models effectively for k=84, with k=87 failing to converge. This seems to be because compared to tanh, ELU helps a lot. It does not saturate on one end like Tanh does.

It scales all layers to being in a range, and that massively helps stability.\n",

The residual also does not allow the signal to ever die down, always keeping some of the past signal alive. This provides us huge leaps in trainability with k=900 being trainable! It takes about 20 minutes to run a single k value at this depth on Colab so I was unable to search for the edge where we fail to converge.
